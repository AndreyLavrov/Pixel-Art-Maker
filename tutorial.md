## Application Launch Trobleshooting 

#### Cached files

Your browser may cache some files with similar name and size from other projects.
Please, use Developer Tools in your browser to check Sources. All files should have exactly the same content as show in Orion Editor.
If you see any difference then you have "Cached files" problem definitely.

To sovle this problem simply clear your browser cache (especially images and files).

### Sudden authorization request

Sometimes browsers try to require authorization from an app in preview mode.
If you see "/?authuser=0" at the end of the URL then you see this kind of behavior definitely.

To solve this problem simply delete "/?authuser=0" part of the URL in your address bar then press Enter and/or refresh your browser window.
